# 1. Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for PriceControl. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

## Starter Template or Existing Project
The project will be bootstrapped using the **T3 Stack**. This provides a pre-configured, production-ready starting point that includes:
* Next.js (App Router)
* TypeScript
* Tailwind CSS
* Drizzle ORM (for database access)
* NextAuth.js (for authentication)

This choice accelerates initial setup and enforces end-to-end type safety.
