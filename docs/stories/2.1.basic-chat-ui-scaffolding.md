# Story 2.1: Basic Chat UI Scaffolding

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a user, I want a clean and intuitive layout for the chat interface, so that I can easily view my conversation and type new queries.

## Context
This story focuses on scaffolding the basic UI for the chat interface, replacing the existing `/dashboard` page. It will establish the visual structure for future chat functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  The `/dashboard` page is replaced with a dedicated chat layout.
2.  The layout includes a main message display area that can scroll.
3.  The layout includes a text input field at the bottom of the screen for user queries.
4.  A "Send" button is present next to the input field.
5.  The UI is built with shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS and is statically rendered (no functionality yet).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create a new page at `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` that serves as the main chat layout.
- [ ] Implement the main message display area within `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` with scrolling capabilities.
- [ ] Implement a text input field at the bottom of the screen for user queries within `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`.
- [ ] Add a "Send" button next to the input field within `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`.
- [ ] Ensure all UI components are built using shadcn/ui and styled with Tailwind CSS.
- [ ] Ensure the page is statically rendered (no functionality yet).
- [ ] Add unit tests for the new components in `apps/web/src/components/`.

## Dev Notes

- **API Specifications**: No API endpoints are implemented or consumed in this story. [Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md]
- **Component Specifications**: UI components should leverage shadcn/ui. [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **File Locations**: New page will be `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`. UI components should be placed in `apps/web/src/components/`. [Source: architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md]
- **Testing Requirements**: Unit/component tests should be co-located with components, using Vitest and React Testing Library. [Source: architecture/14-testing-strategy.md]
- **Technical Constraints**: Next.js App Router, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS. [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
