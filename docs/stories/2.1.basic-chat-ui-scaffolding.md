# Story 2.1: Basic Chat UI Scaffolding

## Status
Ready

## Story
As a user, I want a clean and intuitive layout for the chat interface, so that I can easily view my conversation and type new queries.

## Context
This story focuses on scaffolding the basic UI for the chat interface, replacing the existing `/dashboard` page. It will establish the visual structure for future chat functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `/dashboard` renders the new chat layout by updating the existing file at `apps/web/app/(protected)/dashboard/page.tsx` (do not create `src/app`).
2. Route protection and layout structure remain intact (use the existing `(protected)` segment and middleware as-is).
3. The layout includes a scrollable main message display area.
4. A text input field is fixed at the bottom of the viewport for user queries.
5. A "Send" button is present adjacent to the input field.
6. UI uses shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS utilities; render is static (no API calls or interactive handlers yet).
7. Responsiveness: layout remains usable at sm, md, and lg breakpoints without overflow issues.
8. Accessibility: input is focusable via keyboard; Send button is reachable and labelled for screen readers.
9. Tests: unit/component tests exist for the page layout (or add the Vitest + RTL test setup if missing), and a `test` script is available in `apps/web/package.json`.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Update `apps/web/app/(protected)/dashboard/page.tsx` in-place to render the chat layout (do not introduce `src/app`).
- [x] Implement a scrollable message display area within that page.
- [x] Implement a bottom-fixed composer with a text input and adjacent "Send" button.
- [x] Use shadcn/ui primitives and Tailwind utilities for styling.
- [x] Ensure the page is statically rendered (no API calls or client handlers beyond layout markup).
- [x] Maintain route protection and existing layout wrappers from the `(protected)` group.
- [x] Add/confirm test setup in `apps/web` (Vitest + React Testing Library) and a `test` script in `package.json`.
- [x] Add minimal unit tests verifying: (a) message area renders, (b) input is present and focusable, (c) Send button renders with accessible label.

## Dev Notes
- Previous Story Insights: 1.6.1 avatar menu fix has no direct impact here.
- Data Models: Not used; this is layout-only scaffolding. [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md]
- API Specifications: None consumed/implemented. [Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md]
- Component Specifications: Use shadcn/ui. [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- File Locations: Update the existing `apps/web/app/(protected)/dashboard/page.tsx`. New UI helpers, if any, in `apps/web/components/`. [Source: architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md]
- Testing Requirements: Co-locate unit/component tests; use Vitest + React Testing Library. [Source: architecture/14-testing-strategy.md]
- Technical Constraints: Next.js App Router, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS. [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]

## Scrum Master Notes
- This story replaces the existing `/dashboard` page with a new chat UI layout. Ensure the previous protected route functionality is maintained.

## Testing
- Manual:
  - Navigate to `/dashboard` and verify the chat UI layout is displayed using the existing protected route.
  - Verify the message area scroll behavior and no layout overflow at sm/md/lg breakpoints.
  - Verify the text input field and Send button are present and keyboard accessible.
  - Verify styling is consistent with shadcn/ui + Tailwind and that the page is statically rendered.
- Automated:
  - Run unit tests in `apps/web` (Vitest + RTL) covering presence of the message area, input, and Send button.

## QA Results

Early Validation (2025-09-16)
- Decision: CONCERNS
- Gate: CONCERNS → qa/gates/2.1-basic-chat-ui-scaffolding.yml
- Rationale:
  1) Pathing mismatch: Story references `apps/web/src/app/...` but the repo
     uses `apps/web/app` with segment groups (e.g., `(protected)/dashboard`).
     Implementing under `src/app` would create duplicate routing and churn.
  2) Existing page already at `apps/web/app/(protected)/dashboard/page.tsx`.
     Clarify if the task replaces this file in-place (preferred to keep auth
     protection and layout) or creates a new route.
  3) Tests requested but no test runner configured in `apps/web` (no `test`
     script). Per architecture, add Vitest + RTL or update story to defer tests.

Recommendations Before Dev
- Update Tasks paths to target `apps/web/app/(protected)/dashboard/page.tsx`.
- Confirm "replace existing /dashboard" means editing the current file.
- Add/confirm `apps/web` testing setup (Vitest + RTL) or adjust scope.
- Add implicit ACs often missed for UI scaffolds: responsive layout (sm/md/lg),
  keyboard accessibility for input/button, and visual consistency with shadcn/ui.

Acceptance Criteria Traceability
- AC1: Replace `/dashboard` with chat layout → Verify page exists under
  `(protected)/dashboard` and renders chat UI.
- AC2: Scrollable message area → Inspect CSS and overflow behavior.
- AC3: Input field at bottom → Presence and focus behavior.
- AC4: Send button present → Presence and disabled state (if any) when empty.
- AC5: Built with shadcn/ui + Tailwind; static render → Check component sources
  and absence of data fetching or live handlers.

Final QA (2025-09-16)
- Decision: PASS
- Gate: PASS → qa/gates/2.1-basic-chat-ui-scaffolding.yml
- Rationale:
  - AC1–AC6 satisfied: dashboard updated in-place at `apps/web/app/(protected)/dashboard/page.tsx`, chat layout renders using shadcn/ui + Tailwind, thread scrolls, composer present (disabled), no API calls.
  - AC7–AC8: responsive scaffolding behaves at sm/md/lg; input/button keyboard accessible with labels.
  - AC9: Vitest + RTL config and minimal tests added; script available. Run under Node 20.x per engines.

## Dev Agent Record
- Assigned To: Dev Agent
- Priority: Medium
- Notes: Implement basic chat UI scaffolding.
- File List:
  - `apps/web/app/(protected)/dashboard/page.tsx`
  - `apps/web/__tests__/chat-ui-scaffold.test.tsx`
  - `apps/web/vitest.config.ts`

## Change Log
- 2025-09-16: Updated dashboard to always render chat layout; composer disabled to keep static scaffold per Story 2.1. Added minimal tests and vitest config; added test script to apps/web/package.json.

## Status
Ready for Review
