# Story 1.1: Project Initialization & Vercel Deployment

## Status: Approved

## Story

- As a developer
- I want to set up the initial monorepo, Next.js application, and connect it to Vercel
- so that we have a live, deployable foundation for all future work.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  A new monorepo is created and pushed to a Git repository.
2.  A new Next.js application using the App Router is initialized within the monorepo.
3.  The project is successfully connected to a Vercel project.
4.  A basic "Hello World" or default index page is successfully deployed and viewable at a public Vercel URL.
5.  Vercel deployments are automatically triggered on pushes to the main branch.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1 (AC: 1, 2): Initialize pnpm monorepo and create Next.js app.
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Create the directory structure as defined in `docs/pricecontrol-ai-architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md`.
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Initialize pnpm workspace.
  - [x] Subtask 1.3: Create the Next.js application in `apps/web`.
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 3, 5): Connect to Vercel.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Create a new Vercel project and link it to the Git repository.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Configure Vercel to automatically deploy from the `main` branch.
- [-] Task 3 (AC: 4): Deploy a basic page.
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Create a simple "Hello World" page in the Next.js app.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Push changes to the `main` branch to trigger a deployment.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Verify the deployment at the public Vercel URL.

## Dev Notes

- **Tech Stack**:
  - Next.js `~14.2`
  - TypeScript `~5.4`
  - pnpm `~9.x`
  - Vercel for deployment
  - [Source: `docs/pricecontrol-ai-architecture/3-tech-stack.md`]
- **Project Structure**:
  - The Next.js application should be created inside `apps/web`.
  - The root `package.json` should be configured for a pnpm workspace.
  - [Source: `docs/pricecontrol-ai-architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md`]
- **Deployment**:
  - The project will be deployed to Vercel.
  - Pushes to `main` will trigger production deployments.
  - [Source: `docs/pricecontrol-ai-architecture/12-deployment-architecture.md`]
- **Development Workflow**:
  - Use `pnpm install` for setup.
  - Use `pnpm dev` to run the local server.

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:
- [ ] Vitest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] No integration test required for this story.
- [ ] Playwright E2E: location: `/e2e/epic-1/deployment.test.ts`
  - A test should verify that the main page loads and contains "Hello World".

Manual Test Steps:
- After deployment, navigate to the Vercel URL and confirm the "Hello World" page is visible.
