# Story 1.3: Authentication UI Components

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to see and interact with sign-up and login forms,
**so that** I can begin the process of creating an account or logging in.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A `/signup` page is created containing a form with fields for email and password.
2. A `/login` page is created containing a form with fields for email and password.
3. All form components are built using shadcn/ui and styled with Tailwind CSS.
4. Basic client-side validation (e.g., required fields, valid email format) is present on the forms.
5. The forms are not yet connected to any backend APIs; submitting them does nothing.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create `/signup` page with email and password fields (AC: 1)
- [x] Create `/login` page with email and password fields (AC: 2)
- [x] Implement UI with shadcn/ui components and Tailwind styles (AC: 3)
- [x] Add client-side validation using Zod + react-hook-form (AC: 4)
- [x] Ensure submit handlers do not call backend APIs yet; show no-op or toast (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- Pages
  - Signup: `apps/web/app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx`
  - Login: `apps/web/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`
- UI Library
  - Uses shadcn/ui components: `Button`, `Input`, `Card`, and a local `FormField` wrapper.
- Validation
  - Zod schemas live at `apps/web/lib/validators.ts` (`signupSchema`, `loginSchema`) integrated via `zodResolver`.
- Scope
  - No backend calls yet; handlers may display a toast as a placeholder.
  - Actual registration/login endpoints are implemented in Stories 1.4 and 1.5 and wired in Story 1.6.

### Testing
- Visual and functional checks (manual):
  - Navigate to `/signup` and `/login`.
  - Fields render with labels; invalid email triggers validation; password requirements enforced.
  - Submit with invalid data shows client-side validation errors.
  - Submit with valid data shows a harmless placeholder (e.g., toast), not a backend call.

## QA Results

Decision: PASS

Summary
- The `/signup` and `/login` pages exist and render email and password fields using shadcn/ui components with Tailwind styling.
- Client-side validation is implemented via Zod and react-hook-form.
- Submit handlers are intentionally not wired to any backend; they present a no-op toast, satisfying the “UI only” requirement.

Evidence
- Files:
  - `apps/web/app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx`: Uses `signupSchema` with `zodResolver`, renders `Input`, `Button`, `Card`, `FormField`. Submit shows toast and avoids API calls.
  - `apps/web/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`: Uses `loginSchema` with `zodResolver`, renders `Input`, `Button`, `Card`, `FormField`. Submit shows toast and avoids API calls.
  - `apps/web/lib/validators.ts`: Defines `signupSchema` and `loginSchema` matching email and password validation requirements.

Risks / Notes
- Accessibility: Labels and error messages are present; suggest verifying aria attributes from `FormField` wrapper during later QA.
- Navigation: Current behavior does not redirect on submit (correct for this story). Redirects will be validated in Story 1.6.

Recommendations
- No changes required for Story 1.3. Proceed with Story 1.4 (registration API) and 1.5 (login/session), then Story 1.6 to wire UI.
