# Story 1.4: User Registration API Endpoint

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to create a secure API endpoint for user registration,
**so that** new users can be created and stored in the database.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new API route is created at `/api/auth/register`.
2. The endpoint accepts a POST request with an email and password.
3. The endpoint validates the incoming data.
4. The password is securely hashed before being stored.
5. A new user record is successfully created in the `users` table in the Neon database.
6. A success response is returned upon user creation.
7. An appropriate error response is returned if the user already exists or if there is an error.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Dependencies & Setup (AC: 2–4)
  - [ ] Ensure `zod` is available for request validation.
  - [ ] Add `bcryptjs` for password hashing if not installed.
- [ ] Validation (AC: 2–3)
  - [ ] Add register schema in `apps/web/lib/validators.ts` (email, password rules).
- [ ] API Route (AC: 1–7)
  - [ ] Implement `apps/web/app/api/auth/register/route.ts` with `POST` handler:
    - [ ] Parse and validate input using Zod.
    - [ ] Check for existing user by email (unique constraint).
    - [ ] Hash password with `bcryptjs` and insert user via Drizzle.
    - [ ] Return 201 on success; 409 on duplicate; 400/500 on validation/other errors.
- [ ] Documentation
  - [ ] Add brief README note about the route and payload shape.

## Dev Notes
- Alignment
  - PRD Story 1.4 specifies creating the registration endpoint prior to wiring UI (Story 1.6).
  - Uses the `users` table and Drizzle setup from Story 1.2.
- Security
  - Never log raw passwords; use `bcryptjs` with a safe salt rounds setting (e.g., 10).
  - Unique email constraint should be enforced both at app-level (check before insert) and in DB.
- Non-goals
  - No NextAuth session issuance here; that’s Story 1.5 (login & session).
  - No UI wiring; that’s Story 1.6.

### Testing
- Manual test via cURL or REST client acceptable for this story:
  - `POST /api/auth/register` with `{ "email": "test@example.com", "password": "..." }`.
  - Expect 201 on first attempt; 409 on duplicate.
- Unit test of validation logic may be added later with broader test scaffolding.

### File List

- Traceability
  - Aligns with AGENT_HANDOFF.md → Next Steps → (4) Authentication.
  - Mirrors PRD 6-epic-1-foundation-user-onboarding.md → Story 1.4 AC 1–7.
  - Depends on Story 1.2 (DB & Drizzle) for `users` schema and DB connectivity.
