# Story 1.5: User Login & Session Management

## Status
Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to implement secure login and session management,
**so that** existing users can authenticate and establish a session.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. NextAuth is configured with a Credentials provider that validates email/password combinations against the Neon database using bcrypt.
2. The NextAuth handler is exposed at `/api/auth/[...nextauth]`, supporting GET/POST, and server routes can consume `getServerSession` for session checks.
3. The helper endpoint at `/api/auth/login` accepts a JSON payload, validates it with zod, and responds with guidance to use the NextAuth Credentials callback.
4. Successful credential sign-in issues a secure session cookie that backend routes rely on; responses never expose sensitive details.
5. Invalid credentials return a generic error message without revealing whether the email exists.
6. When `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` are set, the Google OAuth provider is registered and surfaced through `GET /api/auth/providers` so the login experience can render the Google button.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Dependencies & Setup
  - [x] Install and configure `next-auth` (Auth.js) in `apps/web`.
  - [x] Document environment requirements: `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `NEXTAUTH_URL`, `DATABASE_URL`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`.
- [x] Auth Configuration
  - [x] Create `apps/web/lib/auth.ts` configuring NextAuth with:
    - [x] Credentials provider validating email/password using Drizzle and `bcryptjs.compare`.
    - [x] Google OAuth provider guarded behind env credentials (disabled when unset).
  - [x] Set session strategy (JWT) and callbacks to include `user.id` and `email` in token/session.
  - [x] Verify `GET /api/auth/providers` surfaces Google when configured and document fallback when absent.
- [x] Auth Route Handler
  - [x] Add `apps/web/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` exporting NextAuth `GET`/`POST` handlers.
- [x] Login Helper Endpoint
  - [x] Implement `apps/web/app/api/auth/login/route.ts` (POST):
    - [x] Validate input via shared Zod schema.
    - [x] Return instructions (or 307 redirect) guiding clients to use the NextAuth Credentials flow so cookies are issued correctly.
    - [x] Return 400 on invalid payload; never expose whether the email exists.
- [x] Documentation
  - [x] Update README with NextAuth setup, required env vars (including Google), and login flow expectations.

## Dev Notes
- Alignment
  - Mirrors PRD Story 1.5 requirements for login and session.
  - Builds on Story 1.2 (DB) and complements Story 1.4 (registration).
  - Route protection and UI wiring occur in Story 1.6.
- Environment
  - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `NEXTAUTH_URL`, `DATABASE_URL`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` must be set locally and in Vercel (document only in this story).
- Implementation guidance
  - Credentials provider: lookup user by email via Drizzle, compare `bcrypt` hash, return minimal user object on success.
  - Session: use JWT strategy; include `sub`/`id` and `email` in token for easy access.
  - `/api/auth/login` can 307 redirect to NextAuth’s credentials callback to ensure cookies are set by the browser; for API clients, advise calling `/api/auth/[...nextauth]` using the official flow.
  - `GET /api/auth/providers` automatically surfaces configured providers; ensure login UI reads this endpoint so Google appears when env credentials exist.
- Security
  - Do not leak whether email exists; return generic invalid credentials message.
  - Rate limiting deferred to later stories (Upstash).

### Testing
- Manual:
  - POST `/api/auth/login` with valid credentials → success (and cookie via browser redirect), 401 on invalid.
  - Call `GET /api/auth/providers` with and without Google env credentials to verify provider list.
  - Direct NextAuth credentials call (when wired in UI) will be validated in Story 1.6.
- Automated:
  - API route tests mocking session context to verify 401/201/200.
  - Add tests ensuring provider registration logic exposes Google when env keys are set.

## Dev Agent Record
### Agent Model Used
gpt-5-codex

### Debug Log References

- `pnpm --filter @pricecontrol/web test` (fails in sandbox: Node v24 is unsupported; rerun locally on Node 20.x to execute Vitest suite).

### Completion Notes List
- Confirmed NextAuth credentials + JWT session configuration satisfies Story 1.5 acceptance criteria, including optional Google provider gating.
- Added Vitest coverage in `apps/web/__tests__/auth-nextauth-config.test.ts` for credential success/failure, Google provider toggling, and session callback data.
- Added `apps/web/__tests__/api-auth-login.test.ts` to exercise the helper endpoint happy-path guidance and invalid payload handling.

### File List

- Added: `apps/web/lib/auth.ts`
- Added: `apps/web/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`
- Added: `apps/web/app/api/auth/login/route.ts`
- Added: `apps/web/__tests__/auth-nextauth-config.test.ts`
- Added: `apps/web/__tests__/api-auth-login.test.ts`
- Updated: `apps/web/package.json` (add `next-auth`)
- Updated: `apps/web/pnpm-lock.yaml`

- Traceability
  - Aligns with AGENT_HANDOFF.md → Next Steps → (4) Authentication.
  - Mirrors PRD `6-epic-1-foundation-user-onboarding.md` → Story 1.5 AC 1–6.
  - Depends on Story 1.2 (DB) and complements Story 1.4 (registration) before Story 1.6 (UI wiring & route protection).

## QA Results
Decision: PASS

Summary
- Credentials provider validates bcrypt hashes via Drizzle lookup and normalizes email casing (apps/web/lib/auth.ts:25).
- JWT session callback carries user id/email for downstream API checks, aligning with Story 1.6 needs (apps/web/lib/auth.ts:73).
- Helper endpoint returns guidance and input validation without leaking account existence (apps/web/app/api/auth/login/route.ts:8).

Validation
- `pnpm --filter @pricecontrol/web test` (Node 20.x) — passes including `auth-nextauth-config` and `api-auth-login` suites.

Risks / Follow-ups
- Google provider auto-provisions users with placeholder password; ensure downstream flows treat "google-oauth" sentinel as non-login credential and consider tightening account linking before launch.
