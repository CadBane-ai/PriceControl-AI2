## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the initial monorepo, Next.js application, and connect it to Vercel,
**so that** we have a live, deployable foundation for all future work.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new monorepo is created and pushed to a Git repository.
2. A new Next.js application using the App Router is initialized within the monorepo.
3. The project is successfully connected to a Vercel project.
4. A basic "Hello World" or default index page is successfully deployed and viewable at a public Vercel URL.
5. Vercel deployments are automatically triggered on pushes to the main branch.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Scaffold monorepo foundation (AC: 1–2)
  - [x] Create pnpm-powered monorepo with `apps/*` and `packages/*` workspaces checked into Git.
  - [x] Initialize a new Next.js App Router app inside `apps/web` with TypeScript, Tailwind, and shadcn baseline.
  - [x] Add root tooling (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.base.json`, `.gitignore`) and ensure repository commits compile from root.
- [x] Establish Vercel project linkage (AC: 3)
  - [x] Create or connect a Vercel project pointing at the Git repository main branch. (User Action Required)
  - [x] Configure project settings (framework preset, build command `pnpm build`, output directory `.next`).
  - [x] Store required build environment variables or notes for later stories (no secrets committed).
- [x] First deployment & verification (AC: 4)
  - [x] Trigger initial deployment from linked Git commit and verify the default index renders at the public Vercel URL.
  - [ ] Capture the deployed URL and document it in `README.md`.
- [x] CI/CD automation (AC: 5)
  - [x] Confirm pushes to `main` automatically build and deploy via Vercel (e.g., push a test commit or use Vercel deploy hooks).
  - [ ] Document deployment workflow, including preview deployment behavior for pull requests.
- [ ] Documentation
  - [ ] Update root `README.md` with monorepo layout, local dev commands, and Vercel deployment steps.
  - [ ] Record onboarding steps for new contributors (cloning, installing pnpm, triggering Vercel previews).

## Dev Notes
- Project setup
  - Package manager: pnpm (docs/prd/1-goals-and-background-context.md → Development Workflow preferences).
  - Monorepo layout: `apps/web` Next.js App Router app with room for future packages (`packages/*`).
  - Aligns with architecture `tech-stack.md` (Next.js 14 App Router, pnpm, TypeScript).
- Deployment
  - Vercel is the canonical hosting provider; link repository via Vercel CLI (`vercel link`) or dashboard.
  - Default build command: `pnpm build`; install command: `pnpm install`; output directory: `.next`.
  - Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` (or equivalent) is documented for later stories but do not commit secrets.
- Source control & CI
  - Initial commit should include monorepo scaffolding and Next.js starter pushed to remote (GitHub) before linking to Vercel.
  - Vercel will handle build pipeline; no GitHub Actions changes required yet. Document preview deployments for PRs.
- Traceability
  - Mirrors PRD `6-epic-1-foundation-user-onboarding.md` → Story 1.1 AC 1–5 (v4).
  - Aligns with `docs/architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md` and `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md` for layout and linting conventions.

### Testing
- Minimum verification
  - `pnpm install` and `pnpm dev` succeed locally from the monorepo root.
  - Vercel deployment completes without errors and renders the default index page publicly.
- Optional checks
  - Run `pnpm lint` to confirm App Router scaffolding respects coding standards.
  - Validate preview deployments trigger on pull requests (document observations).

### Debug Log References
- `pnpm install` output (successful)
- `pnpm build` output (successful)

### Completion Notes List

- Monorepo scaffolding, Vercel linkage, and deployment details to be captured here once implementation completes under updated scope.
- Confirmed existing `apps/web` project is a Next.js App Router app with TypeScript, Tailwind, and shadcn baseline.
- Root tooling (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.base.json`, `.gitignore`) verified.
- `pnpm install` and `pnpm build` executed successfully from root.
- `apps/web/vercel.json` configured with `nextjs` framework, `pnpm install` and `pnpm build` commands.
- Environment variables from `apps/web/.env.example` identified for later stories.
- **User Action Required**: Please create or connect the Vercel project to the Git repository main branch, trigger the initial deployment, verify the public URL, and confirm CI/CD automation.
- **User Confirmed**: Vercel project setup, initial deployment, and CI/CD automation are complete and verified by the user.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-18
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
- Initial monorepo and Next.js app scaffolding appears to follow conventions. Local builds (`pnpm install`, `pnpm build`) are successful.

### Refactoring Performed
- None by QA.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ (Initial setup aligns with expected standards)
- Project Structure: ✓ (Monorepo and Next.js app structure is as expected)
- Testing Strategy: ✓ (Automated tests can now be run/verified as Vercel deployment is complete)
- All ACs Met: ✓ (ACs 1, 3, 4, 5 are now confirmed complete by user action)

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] User to complete Vercel project creation/connection.
- [x] User to trigger and verify initial Vercel deployment.
- [x] User to confirm CI/CD automation for Vercel deployments.
- [ ] Run automated tests after Vercel deployment is verified.

### Security Review
- No new security concerns introduced by completed tasks. Existing risks (OPS-1.1 Vercel linkage) are now mitigated by user action.

### Performance Considerations
- No new performance concerns introduced by completed tasks.

### Files Modified During Review
- None by QA.
