# Story 1.1: Project Initialization & Vercel Deployment

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the initial monorepo, Next.js application, and connect it to Vercel,
**so that** we have a live, deployable foundation for all future work.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new monorepo is created and pushed to a Git repository.
2. A new Next.js application using the App Router is initialized within the monorepo.
3. The project is successfully connected to a Vercel project.
4. A basic "Hello World" or default index page is successfully deployed and viewable at a public Vercel URL.
5. Vercel deployments are automatically triggered on pushes to the main branch.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Scaffold monorepo foundation (AC: 1–2)
  - [ ] Create pnpm-powered monorepo with `apps/*` and `packages/*` workspaces checked into Git.
  - [ ] Initialize a new Next.js App Router app inside `apps/web` with TypeScript, Tailwind, and shadcn baseline.
  - [ ] Add root tooling (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.base.json`, `.gitignore`) and ensure repository commits compile from root.
- [ ] Establish Vercel project linkage (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create or connect a Vercel project pointing at the Git repository main branch.
  - [ ] Configure project settings (framework preset, build command `pnpm build`, output directory `.next`).
  - [ ] Store required build environment variables or notes for later stories (no secrets committed).
- [ ] First deployment & verification (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Trigger initial deployment from linked Git commit and verify the default index renders at the public Vercel URL.
  - [ ] Capture the deployed URL and document it in `README.md`.
- [ ] CI/CD automation (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Confirm pushes to `main` automatically build and deploy via Vercel (e.g., push a test commit or use Vercel deploy hooks).
  - [ ] Document deployment workflow, including preview deployment behavior for pull requests.
- [ ] Documentation
  - [ ] Update root `README.md` with monorepo layout, local dev commands, and Vercel deployment steps.
  - [ ] Record onboarding steps for new contributors (cloning, installing pnpm, triggering Vercel previews).

## Dev Notes
- Project setup
  - Package manager: pnpm (docs/prd/1-goals-and-background-context.md → Development Workflow preferences).
  - Monorepo layout: `apps/web` Next.js App Router app with room for future packages (`packages/*`).
  - Aligns with architecture `tech-stack.md` (Next.js 14 App Router, pnpm, TypeScript).
- Deployment
  - Vercel is the canonical hosting provider; link repository via Vercel CLI (`vercel link`) or dashboard.
  - Default build command: `pnpm build`; install command: `pnpm install`; output directory: `.next`.
  - Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` (or equivalent) is documented for later stories but do not commit secrets.
- Source control & CI
  - Initial commit should include monorepo scaffolding and Next.js starter pushed to remote (GitHub) before linking to Vercel.
  - Vercel will handle build pipeline; no GitHub Actions changes required yet. Document preview deployments for PRs.
- Traceability
  - Mirrors PRD `6-epic-1-foundation-user-onboarding.md` → Story 1.1 AC 1–5 (v4).
  - Aligns with `docs/architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md` and `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md` for layout and linting conventions.

### Testing
- Minimum verification
  - `pnpm install` and `pnpm dev` succeed locally from the monorepo root.
  - Vercel deployment completes without errors and renders the default index page publicly.
- Optional checks
  - Run `pnpm lint` to confirm App Router scaffolding respects coding standards.
  - Validate preview deployments trigger on pull requests (document observations).

### Completion Notes List

- Monorepo scaffolding, Vercel linkage, and deployment details to be captured here once implementation completes under updated scope.

### File List

- To be updated with actual files touched once development executes against revised story scope.

## QA Results

2025-09-18 – Manual risk and traceability review recorded in `docs/qa/assessments/epic1-story-1.1-1.7-risk-traceability-20250918.md`. Primary risks: TECH-1.1 (pnpm scaffold drift) and OPS-1.1 (Vercel linkage). Mitigations documented; recommend pre-deploy smoke run plus Vercel dashboard verification.
