# Story 2.7: Create & Switch Conversations

## Status
In Review

## Story
As a user, I want to create new conversations and switch between them, so I can keep topics separated and return to them later.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Authenticated routes exist at `GET /api/conversations`, `POST /api/conversations`, and `PATCH /api/conversations/{id}`; all require a valid NextAuth session and return 401 otherwise. Creating without a title defaults to "Untitled conversation".
2. Conversations are persisted in Neon Postgres via Drizzle ORM with fields `id`, `userId`, `title`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, and responses sort by latest `updatedAt` so recent threads appear first.
3. The sidebar "New conversation" button calls the POST endpoint, prepends the returned conversation locally, navigates to `/dashboard?conversation={id}`, and fires a confirmation toast.
4. The sidebar renders the user's conversations with recency badges (Today/Yesterday/date) and highlights the entry matching the `conversation` query parameter.
5. Users can rename conversations via a dialog that calls `PATCH /api/conversations/{id}` with a trimmed title; success updates the local list and shows a toast, while blank titles are rejected with a validation error toast.
6. Security & errors: unauthorized requests receive 401, invalid rename payloads return 400, and unknown conversation IDs return 404; UI surfaces errors without breaking the sidebar.
7. Tests: unit/integration coverage ensures auth gating, creation/list ordering, rename success/error paths, plus a UI test covering new conversation creation, navigation, and rename feedback.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Database Schema (AC: 1–2)
  - [x] Add Drizzle schema: `apps/web/db/schema/conversations.ts` (tables: `conversations`, `messages`).
  - [x] Ensure `updatedAt` is maintained for sorting (use triggers or application logic).
- [x] API Routes (AC: 1, 5–6)
  - [x] Add `apps/web/app/api/conversations/route.ts` (GET, POST) with session enforcement and default title fallback.
  - [ ] Add `apps/web/app/api/conversations/[id]/route.ts` (PATCH) to handle rename with validation and ownership checks.
- [x] Sidebar UX (AC: 3–4)
  - [x] Wire sidebar button in `apps/web/components/dashboard/sidebar.tsx` to create and navigate to the new conversation.
  - [ ] Render recency badges (Today/Yesterday/date) for each conversation entry.
  - [x] Highlight the active conversation using the `conversation` query param.
  - [ ] Surface creation success toast and graceful error toasts.
- [ ] Rename UX (AC: 5–6)
  - [ ] Implement rename dialog component that trims input, enforces non-empty titles, and calls PATCH endpoint.
  - [ ] Show success toast on rename and validation error toast on blanks.
  - [ ] Handle backend errors (404/500) with non-blocking UI messaging.
- [ ] Testing (AC: 7)
  - [ ] API tests for GET/POST/PATCH covering auth gating, default title, and error cases.
  - [ ] UI test covering new conversation creation, navigation, recency badges, and rename success/error flows.
- [ ] Documentation & Migrations
  - [ ] Run migrations against Neon: `pnpm -C apps/web drizzle:generate && pnpm -C apps/web drizzle:migrate`.
  - [ ] Update README with conversation management endpoints and migration instructions.

## Dev Notes
- Requires env var `DATABASE_URL` and valid NextAuth session for API access.
- Recency badges can reuse date-fns formatting utilities; ensure locale consistency.
- Toast messaging should reuse the global notification system used elsewhere (e.g., shadcn `useToast`).
- Keep optimistic UI updates in sync with server responses; revert changes if API fails.
- Message persistence is defined in the architecture and will be hooked up during streaming/story 2.3+ implementation.

## Testing
- Manual
  - Log in, open the sidebar, click "New conversation" → verify toast, navigation to `?conversation={id}`, and new entry at top with "Today" badge.
  - Rename a conversation → success toast, title updates everywhere, blank title shows validation error toast.
  - Trigger API errors (network/offline) → verify sidebar remains functional and toasts surface issues.
  - Call APIs without a session → confirm 401 responses.
- Automated
  - API tests covering GET/POST/PATCH auth gating, default titles, rename validation, and error paths.
  - UI test (Playwright or RTL) covering create, navigation, badge rendering, and rename success/error feedback.
