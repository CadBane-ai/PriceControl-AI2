# 10. Next Steps

This PRD now serves as the source of truth for the development of the MVP. The next steps will be handled by our specialist agents, who will use this document as their primary input.

## UX Expert Prompt
> "Sally, please review this completed PRD. Based on the requirements in Section 3 (User Interface Design Goals) and the defined epics and stories, create a comprehensive UI/UX Specification (`front-end-spec.md`). Focus on user flows, wireframes, and component design."

## Architect Prompt
> "Winston, please use this PRD and the forthcoming UI/UX Specification from Sally to create the definitive Fullstack Architecture Document (`fullstack-architecture.md`). Ensure your architecture directly supports all functional and non-functional requirements and provides a clear implementation plan for the development team."
