# 6. Epic 1: Foundation & User Onboarding

**Expanded Epic Goal:** This epic lays the critical groundwork for the entire application. It covers creating the monorepo, setting up the Next.js project, establishing the Vercel deployment pipeline, and implementing a complete, secure user authentication system. By the end of this epic, the project will have a live URL, and users will be able to create an account, log in, and access a protected page.

## Story 1.1: Project Initialization & Vercel Deployment
* **As a** developer,
* **I want** to set up the initial monorepo, Next.js application, and connect it to Vercel,
* **so that** we have a live, deployable foundation for all future work.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A new monorepo is created and pushed to a Git repository.
2.  A new Next.js application using the App Router is initialized within the monorepo.
3.  The project is successfully connected to a Vercel project.
4.  A basic "Hello World" or default index page is successfully deployed and viewable at a public Vercel URL.
5.  Vercel deployments are automatically triggered on pushes to the main branch.

## Story 1.2: Database Setup & ORM Integration
* **As a** developer,
* **I want** to set up the Neon database and integrate the Drizzle ORM into the Next.js application,
* **so that** we can persist and manage user data.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A new Neon Postgres project is created.
2.  The Next.js application is configured with the correct environment variables to connect to the Neon database.
3.  Drizzle ORM is installed and configured in the project.
4.  An initial database schema for a `users` table (including fields for id, email, hashed password) is created using Drizzle.
5.  A Drizzle migration can be successfully run against the Neon database, creating the `users` table.

## Story 1.3: Authentication UI Components
* **As a** user,
* **I want** to see and interact with sign-up and login forms,
* **so that** I can begin the process of creating an account or logging in.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A `/signup` page is created containing a form with fields for email and password.
2.  A `/login` page is created containing a form with fields for email and password.
3.  All form components are built using shadcn/ui and styled with Tailwind CSS.
4.  Basic client-side validation (e.g., required fields, valid email format) is present on the forms.
5.  The forms are not yet connected to any backend APIs; submitting them does nothing.

## Story 1.4: User Registration API Endpoint
* **As a** developer,
* **I want** to create a secure API endpoint for user registration,
* **so that** new users can be created and stored in the database.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A new API route is created at `/api/auth/register`.
2.  The endpoint accepts a POST request with an email and password.
3.  The endpoint validates the incoming data.
4.  The password is securely hashed before being stored.
5.  A new user record is successfully created in the `users` table in the Neon database.
6.  A success response is returned upon user creation.
7.  An appropriate error response is returned if the user already exists or if there is an error.

## Story 1.5: User Login & Session Management
* **As a** developer,
* **I want** to create a secure API endpoint for user login and session creation,
* **so that** existing users can authenticate and establish a session.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A new API route is created at `/api/auth/login`.
2.  The endpoint accepts a POST request with an email and password.
3.  The endpoint verifies the user's credentials against the stored hashed password.
4.  Upon successful authentication, a session (e.g., using Auth.js/NextAuth) is created and a session cookie is returned to the client.
5.  An appropriate error response is returned for invalid credentials.

## Story 1.6: Connect UI to Auth & Protect Routes
* **As a** user,
* **I want** to use the sign-up and login forms to create an account and access a protected page,
* **so that** I can confirm the authentication system works end-to-end.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The sign-up form from Story 1.3 is connected to the registration API from Story 1.4.
2.  The login form from Story 1.3 is connected to the login API from Story 1.5.
3.  After a successful sign-up or login, the user is redirected to a new `/dashboard` page.
4.  The `/dashboard` page is a protected route; unauthenticated users trying to access it are redirected to the login page.
5.  A logged-in user can see a simple "Welcome" message and a logout button on the dashboard.
6.  Clicking the logout button ends the user's session and redirects them to the login page.
