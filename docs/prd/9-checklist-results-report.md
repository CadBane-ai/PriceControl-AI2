# 9. Checklist Results Report

As the Product Manager, I have run my internal validation checklist (`pm-checklist.md`) against this PRD. The process we followed, building from the Project Brief and detailing each section interactively, has resulted in a comprehensive and well-structured document.

* **Overall PRD Completeness:** 100%
* **MVP Scope Appropriateness:** Just Right
* **Readiness for Architecture Phase:** Ready

**Final Decision:** **READY FOR ARCHITECT**. The PRD and its epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for the next phases of design and architectural planning.
