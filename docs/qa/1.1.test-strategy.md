# Test Strategy & Risk Profile for Story 1.1

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy and risk analysis for **Story 1.1: Project Initialization & Vercel Deployment**. The primary goal of this story is to establish a foundational, deployable application.

## 2. Risk Analysis

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| R-1.1.1 | Monorepo setup is incorrect, leading to build or dependency issues. | Low | Medium | Follow `10-unified-project-structure.md` precisely. A successful `pnpm install` and build will validate the setup. |
| R-1.1.2| Vercel connection fails or is misconfigured. | Low | High | Manual verification of the Vercel project settings and the first deployment. E2E tests will confirm the endpoint is live. |
| R-1.1.3 | Automated deployments do not trigger on push to `main`. | Medium | High | A specific E2E test will be run post-merge to `main` to ensure the deployment pipeline is active. Manual verification of Vercel logs. |
| R-1.1.4 | The basic deployed page does not render correctly. | Low | Medium | A Playwright E2E test will check for the "Hello World" text on the deployed page. |

## 3. Test Strategy

### 3.1. Unit Testing

- **Framework:** Vitest with React Testing Library.
- **Scope:** For this foundational story, unit tests are not the primary focus, as there are no complex UI components with business logic. However, a placeholder test for the main page component can be created to ensure the testing framework is correctly configured.
- **Requirement:** Achieve initial setup of Vitest, a passing placeholder test, and meet the 80% coverage goal (which will be trivial for a simple component).

### 3.2. Integration Testing

- **Scope:** No integration tests are required for this story as it does not involve multiple internal services or complex data flows.

### 3.3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

- **Framework:** Playwright
- **Test Case 1: Preview Deployment Verification**
  - **Objective:** Verify that a preview deployment is successful and the application is accessible.
  - **Steps:**
    1. A developer pushes a commit to a feature branch.
    2. A pull request is created.
    3. The test waits for the Vercel bot to post a preview URL.
    4. Playwright navigates to the preview URL.
    5. It asserts that the page title is correct and the "Hello World" text is visible.
- **Test Case 2: Production Deployment Verification**
  - **Objective:** Verify that a push to `main` triggers a successful production deployment.
  - **Steps:**
    1. The pull request is merged to `main`.
    2. The CI/CD pipeline runs the Playwright test against the production URL (once defined).
    3. The Playwright test navigates to the production URL.
    4. It asserts that the page title is correct and the "Hello World" text is visible.

### 3.4. Manual Testing

- **Objective:** Final sign-off on the Vercel project configuration.
- **Steps:**
  1. Manually inspect the Vercel project settings to confirm the correct Git repository is linked.
  2. Confirm that the automatic deployment on push to `main` setting is enabled.
  3. After the first deployment, manually visit the public Vercel URL to ensure the site is live.

## 4. Test Environment

- **Local:** Developer machines for running unit tests.
- **CI/CD:** Vercel's environment for preview and production deployments. Playwright tests will be configured to run in this environment.
