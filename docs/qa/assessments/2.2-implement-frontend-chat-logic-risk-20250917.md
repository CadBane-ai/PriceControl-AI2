- High Risks: 0
- Medium Risks: 2
- Low Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 90/100

## Medium Risks

### 1. TECH-002: Incorrect partial implementation of `useChat`

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - The story requires a non-standard, partial implementation of the `useChat` hook.
**Impact**: Medium - An incorrect implementation could lead to bugs or rework in the next story (2.3) when the backend is connected.
**Mitigation**:
- Action: Add clear comments in the code explaining why the implementation is partial and how it should be completed in the next story.
- Owner: dev
**Testing Focus**: Automated tests must assert that no network call is made on message submission.

### 2. BUS-001: Improper loading indicator feedback

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - The behavior of the loading indicator is critical for user feedback.
**Impact**: Medium - If the indicator doesn't show, users might resubmit the form. If it doesn't hide, users might think the app is stuck.
**Mitigation**:
- Action: The PO has already validated the ACs are clear on this.
- Owner: po
**Testing Focus**: Manual and automated tests must cover the loading indicator's appearance and disappearance.

## Low Risks

### 1. TECH-001: Vercel AI SDK dependency issues

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - It's a well-maintained library.
**Impact**: Medium - Could cause build failures.
**Mitigation**:
- Action: Pin the dependency version in `package.json`.
- Owner: dev
**Testing Focus**: Ensure the application builds and runs after adding the dependency.

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description             | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| TECH-002 | Incorrect `useChat` impl | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| BUS-001  | Improper loading feedback | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| TECH-001 | `ai` dependency issues  | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Medium Risk Tests
- Test that `useChat` is not making any network calls.
- Test the loading indicator appears and disappears correctly.

### Priority 2: Low Risk Tests
- Ensure the application builds and runs with the new dependency.
