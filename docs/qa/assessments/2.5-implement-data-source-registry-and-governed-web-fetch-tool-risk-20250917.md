- High Risks: 3
- Medium Risks: 1
- Low Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 55/100

## High Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-003: `web.fetch` tool complexity

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Web fetching has many edge cases (redirects, content types, etc.).
**Impact**: Medium - The tool might fail for some sources, making it unreliable.
**Mitigation**:
- Action: Use a robust, well-tested library for web fetching. Implement comprehensive error handling and logging.
- Owner: dev
**Testing Focus**: Integration tests should cover a variety of web page types and error conditions.

### 2. SEC-002: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Depends on the implementation of the `web.fetch` tool.
**Impact**: High - A successful SSRF attack could allow an attacker to make requests to internal services.
**Mitigation**:
- Action: The `sourceId` parameter should be an identifier, not a URL. The tool must look up the URL from the `datasources.yml` file based on the `sourceId`.
- Owner: dev
**Testing Focus**: Security code review and penetration testing.

### 3. PERF-001: Slow web fetching

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - External network calls are inherently unpredictable.
**Impact**: Medium - Slow response times will lead to a poor user experience.
**Mitigation**:
- Action: Implement a timeout for all web fetch operations.
- Owner: dev
**Testing Focus**: Performance tests to measure the impact of web fetching on the overall response time.

## Medium Risks

### 1. TECH-001: Malformed `datasources.yml` file

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - YAML is sensitive to formatting errors.
**Impact**: Medium - A parsing error would break the `web.fetch` tool completely.
**Mitigation**:
- Action: Use a robust YAML parsing library with proper error handling.
- Owner: dev
**Testing Focus**: Unit tests with various malformed YAML files.

## Low Risks

### 1. SEC-001: `isAllowedSource` guard bypass

**Score: 3 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - The story is designed to prevent this.
**Impact**: High - Would defeat the purpose of the data governance layer.
**Mitigation**:
- Action: Enforce that the `web.fetch` tool always calls the guard function through code reviews and automated tests.
- Owner: dev
**Testing Focus**: Integration tests that attempt to bypass the guard.

### 2. TECH-002: Buggy caching logic

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Caching is a well-understood pattern.
**Impact**: Medium - The governance layer would not be up-to-date with the latest `datasources.yml`.
**Mitigation**:
- Action: Keep the caching logic simple and provide a mechanism for cache invalidation.
- Owner: dev
**Testing Focus**: Unit tests for the caching logic.

| TECH-001 | Malformed YAML file     | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| SEC-001  | Guard bypass            | Low (1)     | High (3)   | 3     | Low      |
| TECH-002 | Buggy caching logic     | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests
- Integration tests for the `web.fetch` tool covering various web page types and error conditions.
- Security code review and penetration testing for SSRF vulnerabilities.
- Performance tests for the `web.fetch` tool.

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests
- Unit tests for YAML parsing with malformed files.

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests
- Integration tests that attempt to bypass the `isAllowedSource` guard.
- Unit tests for the caching logic.
