- Medium Risks: 2
- Low Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 60/100

## High Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-001: OpenRouter API integration failure

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - External APIs can be unstable or have breaking changes.
**Impact**: High - This is a core functionality of the application.
**Mitigation**:
- Action: Implement robust error handling, retries, and logging for all calls to the OpenRouter API.
- Owner: dev
**Testing Focus**: Integration tests should cover various API error responses from OpenRouter.

### 2. OPS-001: Lack of monitoring for the new API endpoint

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - It is a new critical endpoint.
**Impact**: Medium - Without monitoring, it will be difficult to detect and diagnose issues in production.
**Mitigation**:
- Action: Add logging for all requests and responses. Set up alerts for high error rates or latency.
- Owner: dev
**Testing Focus**: N/A

## Medium Risks

### 1. TECH-002: Mock stream differs from real stream

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Mock data can easily become outdated.
**Impact**: Medium - May lead to bugs that are only discoverable in production.
**Mitigation**:
- Action: Ensure the mock stream's structure and behavior are as close as possible to the real OpenRouter stream.
- Owner: dev
**Testing Focus**: Compare the frontend behavior with both the mock and real streams.

### 2. PERF-001: Slow LLM response time

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - LLM responses can be slow, especially for complex queries.
**Impact**: Medium - A slow response time will lead to a poor user experience.
**Mitigation**:
- Action: Implement a reasonable timeout for the API call and display a message to the user if the response is taking too long.
- Owner: dev
**Testing Focus**: Performance tests to measure the end-to-end response time.

## Low Risks

### 1. TECH-003: Incorrect authentication handling

**Score: 3 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - The story uses NextAuth, a well-established library.
**Impact**: High - A security vulnerability could expose user data.
**Mitigation**:
- Action: Follow NextAuth best practices and documentation.
- Owner: dev
**Testing Focus**: Automated tests must cover all authentication and authorization scenarios.

### 2. SEC-001: Leaked OpenRouter API key

**Score: 3 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Standard practice is to use environment variables.
**Impact**: High - A leaked API key could result in financial loss.
**Mitigation**:
- Action: Store the API key in an environment variable and ensure it is not committed to the repository.
- Owner: dev
**Testing Focus**: Code review to ensure the key is not hardcoded.

| TECH-002 | Mock stream differs from real | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| PERF-001 | Slow LLM response       | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| TECH-003 | Incorrect auth handling | Low (1)     | High (3)   | 3     | Low      |
| SEC-001  | Leaked API key          | Low (1)     | High (3)   | 3     | Low      |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests
- Integration tests for OpenRouter API calls, covering success and error cases.
- Add logging and monitoring to the new API endpoint.

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests
- Compare frontend behavior with mock and real streams.
- Performance tests for the end-to-end response time.

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests
- Automated tests for authentication and authorization.
- Code review for API key handling.
