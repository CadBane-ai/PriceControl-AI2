## High Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-001: Incorrect pathing in story

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - QA results explicitly mention pathing mismatches.
**Impact**: Medium - Would cause rework and churn.
**Mitigation**:
- Immediate action required: Update story with correct file paths.
- Owner: sm/po
**Testing Focus**: Verify implementation is at `apps/web/app/(protected)/dashboard/page.tsx`.

### 2. TECH-002: Test runner not configured

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - QA results mention no test runner is configured.
**Impact**: Medium - Blocks automated testing and validation.
**Mitigation**:
- Immediate action required: Add Vitest + RTL configuration.
- Owner: dev
**Testing Focus**: Ensure `npm run test` works in `apps/web`.

## Medium Risks

### 1. BUS-001: Poor responsiveness

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - A common issue for new UI.
**Impact**: Medium - Poor UX on mobile or large screens.
**Mitigation**:
- Action: Add explicit responsive design requirements to ACs.

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests
- Verify file paths in implementation match the corrected story.
- Ensure test suite runs and passes.

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests
- Manually test UI on different screen sizes.
