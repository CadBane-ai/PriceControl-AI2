Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 7
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 1
- Medium Risks: 2
- Low Risks: 4
- Risk Score: 75/100

## High Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-001: Incorrect database schema design

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Database schema design requires careful planning to avoid future issues.
**Impact**: High - A flawed schema could lead to data integrity problems, performance bottlenecks, or even data loss.
**Mitigation**:
- Action: The database schema should be reviewed by another developer before implementation.
- Owner: dev
**Testing Focus**: N/A

## Medium Risks

### 1. TECH-003: Optimistic UI updates get out of sync

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - A common problem with optimistic UI is that the client state can become inconsistent with the server state if API calls fail.
**Impact**: Medium - The user would see incorrect data, leading to confusion.
**Mitigation**:
- Action: Implement a robust error handling mechanism that reverts optimistic updates on API failure.
- Owner: dev
**Testing Focus**: Integration tests that simulate API failures and verify that the UI reverts to the correct state.

### 2. PERF-001: Slow conversation list loading

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - If a user has a large number of conversations, the `GET /api/conversations` endpoint could become slow.
**Impact**: Medium - A slow-loading conversation list would be a bad user experience for power users.
**Mitigation**:
- Action: Implement pagination for the conversation list endpoint.
- Owner: dev
**Testing Focus**: Performance tests with a large number of conversations.

## Low Risks

### 1. SEC-001: Improper authorization

**Score: 3 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - The story mentions session enforcement.
**Impact**: High - A security vulnerability could allow users to access other users' conversations.
**Mitigation**:
- Action: Ensure that all API endpoints have proper authorization checks.
- Owner: dev
**Testing Focus**: Integration tests that attempt to access conversations belonging to other users.

### 2. TECH-002: Buggy recency badge logic

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Medium - Date and time logic can be tricky.
**Impact**: Low - A minor UI bug.
**Mitigation**:
- Action: Use a reliable date library like `date-fns`.
- Owner: dev
**Testing Focus**: Unit tests for the recency badge logic.

### 3. DATA-001: Incorrect conversation sorting

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - The story mentions using triggers or application logic.
**Impact**: Medium - Conversations would not be sorted correctly.
**Mitigation**:
- Action: Use a database trigger to automatically update the `updatedAt` field.
- Owner: dev
**Testing Focus**: Integration tests to verify that conversations are sorted correctly.

### 4. BUS-001: Unintuitive conversation switching UI

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - The story describes a standard sidebar UI.
**Impact**: Medium - Could lead to user confusion.
**Mitigation**:
- Action: Follow established UI patterns for conversation lists.
- Owner: ux-expert
**Testing Focus**: Manual testing of the conversation switching UI.

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests
- Code review of the database schema.

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests
- Integration tests for optimistic UI updates with API failures.
- Performance tests for the conversation list endpoint.

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests
- Integration tests for authorization.
- Unit tests for recency badge logic.
- Integration tests for conversation sorting.
- Manual testing of the conversation switching UI.
