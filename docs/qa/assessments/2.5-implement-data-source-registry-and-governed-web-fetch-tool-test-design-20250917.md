Designer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Test Strategy Overview

- Total test scenarios: 6
- Unit tests: 3 (50%)
- Integration tests: 3 (50%)
- E2E tests: 0 (0%)
- Priority distribution: P0: 5, P1: 1, P2: 0

## Test Scenarios by Acceptance Criteria

### AC1, AC2: Data Source Registry and Governance

| ID | Level | Priority | Test | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2.5-UNIT-001 | Unit | P0 | Verify that the `datasources.yml` file can be parsed correctly. | Core functionality. |
| 2.5-UNIT-002 | Unit | P0 | Verify that the `isAllowedSource` function correctly identifies allowed and disallowed sources. | Core security logic. |
| 2.5-UNIT-003 | Unit | P1 | Verify that the caching logic for the data source registry works as expected. | Performance and correctness. |

### AC3, AC4, AC5, AC6: `web.fetch` Tool

| ID | Level | Priority | Test | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2.5-INT-001 | Integration | P0 | Verify that the `web.fetch` tool successfully fetches content from an allowed source. | Core functionality. |
| 2.5-INT-002 | Integration | P0 | Verify that the `web.fetch` tool returns an error and does not make a network request for a disallowed source. | Security. |
| 2.5-INT-003 | Integration | P0 | Verify that the `web.fetch` tool handles fetching errors gracefully. | Robustness. |

## Recommended Execution Order

1. P0 Unit tests
2. P0 Integration tests
3. P1 tests in order
