- Total Risks Identified: 7
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 2
- Medium Risks: 1
- Low Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 45/100

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-001: LLM does not follow system prompt instructions

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - LLMs can be unpredictable and may not always follow instructions, especially complex ones involving tool use and citations.
**Impact**: High - The core functionality of this story (tool use and citations) would be completely broken.
**Mitigation**:
- Action: The system prompt must be very clear, well-structured, and extensively tested. Consider using few-shot examples in the prompt.
- Owner: dev
**Testing Focus**: Integration tests must verify that the LLM uses the `web.fetch` tool when appropriate and includes citations in its response.

## High Risks

### 1. PERF-001: Increased response time due to tool use

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Calling an external tool adds significant latency to the response time.
**Impact**: Medium - Users may become frustrated with slow responses.
**Mitigation**:
- Action: The UI must provide clear feedback to the user that a tool is being used (e.g., "Searching the web...").
- Owner: ux-expert
**Testing Focus**: Performance tests to measure the total response time, including tool execution.

### 2. BUS-001: Incorrect or unclear citation display

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - The UI for displaying citations could be confusing or break if the citation format changes.
**Impact**: High - If users cannot trust or verify the AI's sources, the main goal of the story is not met.
**Mitigation**:
- Action: The citation UI should be simple, clear, and robust.
- Owner: ux-expert
**Testing Focus**: Manual testing of the citation display with various source types.

## Medium Risks

### 1. TECH-002: Brittle citation parsing on the frontend

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - The LLM might slightly change its citation format, breaking the frontend parsing logic.
**Impact**: Medium - Citations would not be displayed correctly.
**Mitigation**:
- Action: Use a flexible parsing method (e.g., a regular expression that allows for some variation) and add error handling.
- Owner: dev
**Testing Focus**: Unit tests for the citation parsing logic with various possible formats.

## Low Risks

### 1. SEC-001: `web.fetch` tool security (dependency)

**Score: 3 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - This risk should be mitigated by the implementation of story 2.5.
**Impact**: High - A security vulnerability in the `web.fetch` tool would be a serious issue.
**Mitigation**:
- Action: Verify that the `web.fetch` tool is implemented securely as per story 2.5.
- Owner: dev
**Testing Focus**: N/A (dependency)

### 2. DATA-001: Sensitive information in `ToolCallLog`

**Score: 3 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Depends on the nature of the tool inputs.
**Impact**: High - Could lead to data privacy violations.
**Mitigation**:
- Action: Sanitize all tool inputs before logging them in the `ToolCallLog`.
- Owner: dev
**Testing Focus**: Code review of the logging implementation.

### 3. TECH-003: `ToolCallLog` creation failure

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Database operations are generally reliable.
**Impact**: Medium - Loss of the audit trail for tool calls.
**Mitigation**:
- Action: Add logging and monitoring for the `ToolCallLog` creation process.
- Owner: dev
**Testing Focus**: Integration tests to ensure `ToolCallLog` entries are created correctly.

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- Integration tests to verify that the LLM uses the `web.fetch` tool and provides citations.

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- Performance tests for the end-to-end response time with tool use.
- Manual testing of the citation display.

### Priority 3: Medium Risk Tests
- Unit tests for the citation parsing logic.

### Priority 4: Low Risk Tests
- Code review of the `ToolCallLog` sanitization.
- Integration tests for `ToolCallLog` creation.
