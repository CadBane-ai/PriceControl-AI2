story: "Story 1.6.1: Avatar Menu Not Opening (Logout Inaccessible)"
slug: 1.6.1-avatar-menu-not-opening
decision: PASS
reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)
date: 2025-09-16
rationale: |
  Manual verification confirms the avatar dropdown opens and the Log out
  action redirects to /login as expected. No regressions observed in header
  layout or keyboard accessibility. All acceptance criteria met; risk low.
notes:
  - Local dev validated via `pnpm dev` with .env.local in apps/web
  - Visual behavior consistent across primary routes: /dashboard, /account, /billing
