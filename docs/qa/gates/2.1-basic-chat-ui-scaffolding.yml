story: "Story 2.1: Basic Chat UI Scaffolding"
slug: 2.1-basic-chat-ui-scaffolding
decision: PASS
reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)
date: 2025-09-16
rationale: |
  Post-implementation review confirms the dashboard now renders the static chat
  layout at apps/web/app/(protected)/dashboard/page.tsx using shadcn/ui + Tailwind.
  No data fetching or chat logic is present (static scaffold), the composer is
  disabled, and the thread area scrolls. Route protection and wrappers remain
  intact. Minimal unit tests and Vitest config are in place. Lint passes on
  source. All acceptance criteria for Story 2.1 are met.
notes:
  - Tests execute under Node 20.x; local environment here logs engine warnings.
  - Recommend adding an a11y smoke test in a later story.
