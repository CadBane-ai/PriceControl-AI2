# 3. User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The UX vision is to create a clean, data-dense, and highly efficient interface that prioritizes clarity and instills trust. It should feel like a professional-grade analytical tool, not a generic consumer chat app. All data presented must be clearly sourced and verifiable to the user.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
* **Conversational Interface:** The primary interaction will be a text-based chat with the LLM.
* **Model Selection:** Users will have a clear and simple way to switch between "Instruct" and "Thinking" LLM variants.
* **Data Visualization:** Financial data (e.g., stock prices) will be presented in clear, interactive charts.
* **Source Transparency:** Users should be able to easily see which data source was used for a given response.

### Core Screens and Views
* **Authentication:** Screens for user sign-up, login, and password management.
* **Main Chat Interface:** The primary workspace where users interact with the LLM, view responses, and see visualizations.
* **Subscription & Billing:** A pricing page and a redirect to the Stripe Customer Portal for managing subscriptions.
* **Data Sources Directory:** A reference page listing all approved data sources from the `datasources.yml` file to enhance transparency.

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
* The application will be designed to meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA, ensuring it is usable by people with a wide range of disabilities.

### Branding
* **Initial Recommendation:** As no brand guide has been provided, the branding should be professional, minimalist, and data-forward. The design should use a color palette that inspires confidence and clarity (e.g., dark blues, greys, and clean whites), with a focus on typography that ensures readability of dense financial information.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
* The application will be a responsive web app, providing a seamless experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
