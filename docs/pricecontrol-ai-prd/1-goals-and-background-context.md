# 1. Goals and Background Context

### Goals

* **Launch and Grow:** Launch the MVP within 6 months and acquire an initial user base of 1,000 monthly active users.
* **Validate Business Model:** Achieve a 5% free-to-paid user conversion rate within the first 6 months post-launch to validate the subscription model.
* **Deliver User Value:** Provide a highly engaging and trustworthy user experience, measured by high session query counts and strong weekly user retention.
* **Ensure Trust:** Guarantee data integrity and build user trust by exclusively using a transparent, allow-listed registry of reputable financial sources.

### Background Context

The current market for financial analysis is divided between prohibitively expensive institutional platforms and unreliable general-purpose AI tools. PriceControl addresses this gap by providing a trustworthy, AI-driven financial assistant at an accessible price point.

The core of the solution is an open-source LLM whose data access is strictly governed by a transparent registry of reputable sources. This unique approach combines the analytical power of modern AI with the data integrity required for high-stakes financial decisions, empowering a broader audience of investors and analysts with tools previously reserved for the financial elite.
