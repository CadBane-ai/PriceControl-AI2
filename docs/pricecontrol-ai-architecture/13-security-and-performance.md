# 13. Security and Performance
## Security Requirements
* **Frontend:** Strict Content-Security-Policy (CSP) will be implemented.
* **Backend:** All API inputs will be validated with Zod; rate limiting will be enforced with Upstash Redis.
* **Authentication:** Secure, HTTP-only cookies will be used for session management via NextAuth.js. Secrets will be stored as Vercel Environment Variables.
## Performance Optimization
* **Frontend:** Route-based code-splitting, lazy-loading, and skeleton loaders will be used.
* **Backend:** A caching layer with Upstash Redis will be implemented for frequently accessed data, and cron jobs will pre-warm caches.
